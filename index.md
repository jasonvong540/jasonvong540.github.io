### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 Part 2 is another favorite because it was a program to calculate decimal feet to feet and inches. Even though it's a simple program, it was one of the first programs that taught me how to code a program that uses mathematical equations for the output. I thought it was cool when the measurements I entered converted to the write output.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 Part 3 is my favorite lab because I ihad to complete a program that would play an animation. I never thought I would be able to play an animation through a terminal, but the lab enabled me to. After finishing the code, I was excited to see the animations working and playing.

* Lab 12

    Both parts of Lab 12 were another favorite because it was lab focused on coding a program to create gifs. Seeing the gifs being made and working at 100% made me  think they were the most fun labs.
