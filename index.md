### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 Part 2 is another favorite because it was a program to calculate decimal feet to feet and inches. Even though it's a simple program, it was one of the first programs that taught me how to code a program that uses mathematical equations for the output. I thought it was cool when the measurements I entered converted to the write output. I liked how it introduced the uses for static_cast as well as truncating numbers. For my future mathematical programs, I will keep these in mind and find a use for them.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 Part 3 is my favorite lab because I ihad to complete a program that would play an animation. I never thought I would be able to play an animation through a terminal, but the lab enabled me to. After finishing the code, I was excited to see the animations working and playing. Although it was a short code, it taught me how to use ifstreams to open files and for the program to read them. I liked seeing all of the different animations and scenarios that was provided through my program.

* Lab 12

    Both parts of Lab 12 were another favorite because it was lab focused on coding a program to create gifs. Seeing the gifs being made and working at 100% made me think it was interesting how a program is able to constantly change an image making it seem like its moving but in reality the image is changing frame by frame. I liked that this lab taught us how to use GraphicsMagick to create images and gifs because it taught me how to change colors of individual pixels using for loops to eventually make an image.
